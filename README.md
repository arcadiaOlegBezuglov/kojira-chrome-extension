## What is the point?

Hello! This extension doesn't collect or store any of your information. The only purpose of receiving some information from you is to
secure your browsing experience and to solve SSO authentication issues with Jira and Confluence installations inside the KornFerry network.

## Installation
Since I don't want to stick to any Privacy Policy, and the code is open-sourced, you can checkout and install it by yourself.
